Description
==================================

MH HealthMag is a fresh and beautiful magazine WordPress theme for editorial websites with topics like health, fitness, body, food, beauty or else. This modern magazine theme is a child theme for the popular MH Magazine lite theme which includes various custom widgets to build a well-organized front page to showcase your valuable content.
